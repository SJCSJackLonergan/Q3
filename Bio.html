	<h1>Jack P. Lonergan: From Start to Finish</h1>
	<h3 class="one">The Start</h3>
	<p class="one">Jack was born in San Antonio, TX to his loving parents on 13 February 2001. His father Keith, a military man, had the family move to West Point and eventually to Augusta, GA where they lived for 5 years. It was here also that Jack's brother Kyle and sister Chloe were born. It was Augusta that would be home to Jack's earliest memories and friends. </p>

	<h3 class="two">The Boy Wonder</h3>
	<p class="two">When Jack's parents heard Jack say his first words at only 10 months old they knew he was special. As a young boy, Jack excelled in his grade school classes. He often flew by with flying colors. The boy did so well in fact, he was dubbed a child savant by many of his intructors and mentors. Jack reached high school level learning by age 7. His endeavors astounded all those around him.</p>

	<h3 class="three">The Savant</h3>
	<p class="three">At only 13 years of age the boy understood some of the most difficult concepts man has observed. Attending the Massachusettes Institute of Technology on a full ride he began his steep climb. From multivariable calculus to quantum physics the child came to understand the material even better than his professors. It was only a matter of time before he was the one teaching them. Every person he met over the course of his life knew he was destined for greatness, no matter what happened.</p>

	<h3 class="four">The Legend</h3>
	<p class="four">As Lonergan continued through life he solved the unsolvable. Those concepts that puzzled the great many minds that came before him were child's play. Having proven the Grand Riemann Hypothesis and all its constituents he was awarded the highest matematical honors. He was revered as the strongest mind to ever live. In fact it is the popular notion that he indeed was the smartest man alive untilthat most tragic incident on april of 2033. R.I.P. Dr. Lonergan may your memory live on through the ages.</p>
