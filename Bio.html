	<h3 class="one">The Start</h3>
	<p class="one">Jack was born in San Antonio, TX to his loving parents on 13 February 2001. His father Keith, a military man, had the family move to West Point and eventually to Augusta, GA where they lived for 5 years. It was here also that Jack's brother Kyle and sister Chloe were born. It was Augusta that would be home to Jack's earliest memories and friends. </p>

It was the middle of his first grade year and he was leaving all of his friends behind never to see them again. It was a sad few weeks but it was also a brand new start for the boy. </p>
